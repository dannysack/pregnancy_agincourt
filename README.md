# Pregnancy-related healthcare utilization in Agincourt, South Africa, 1993-2018

This repository contains code for pregnancy-related healthcare utilization in Agincourt, South Africa, 1993-2018

Initially, I submitted a data request at https://data.agincourt.co.za/index.php/home

The data requested are described in the supplement of the published version (https://gh.bmj.com/content/6/10/e006915.full).

This repository includes three files:
1) cleaning.R, which shows how I cleaned the raw data
2) analysis.Rmd, which shows how I performed the analysis
3) figures.Rmd, which shows how I created the figures included in the final publication

Please feel free to reach out with any questions on the analysis. Data are available on request, after going through any requisite Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems processes
